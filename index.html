     <h2>What is Lupus?</h2>

<p>
    The word means "wolf" in Latin. This name was given due to the skin lesions that are very common in Lupus. It is an <strong>autoimmune disease</strong>, where the immune system, instead of protecting the body, attacks it, causing <strong>inflammation</strong> and alteration of the function of the affected system. Inflammation causes pain, heat, redness, and swelling.
</p>

<p>
    There is no known cause for Lupus and there is no cure for this illness. It is a <strong>chronic condition</strong>, although there are inactive phases and reactive phases. It can affect many different organs and systems, and there are very diverse forms of the disease. In fact, symptoms vary from patient to patient and even, in the same patient, from period to period.
</p>

<p>
    Lupus can be associated with serious complications, but, generally speaking, the available treatments allow for the maintenance of a <strong>good quality of life</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The female sex is <strong>eight to ten times more affected</strong>, especially in fertile ages, but men can also be affected. The most frequent ages for the onset of Lupus are between <strong>18 and 55 years</strong>, but this disease can begin at any age (children or the elderly). There are currently about four thousand cases of Lupus in Portugal.
</p>

<p>
    Family members of patients with autoimmune diseases (<strong>thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes</strong>) are more likely to be affected by this disease.
</p>

<h2>What are the different forms of Lupus?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Systemic</strong>, a more generalized disease, which can affect any organ or system of the body;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Discoid</strong>, which is a form limited to the skin that can, sometimes, evolve into systemic Lupus.
    </li>
</ul>

    
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>

<p>
    Its manifestations are highly variable. Among them are <strong>fatigue</strong>, <strong>loss of appetite</strong>, and <strong>weight loss</strong>. Red or pink patches may occur on the skin of the face (especially on the cheeks and nose, in the shape of a butterfly), neck, or arms. These correspond to <strong>discoid lesions</strong>. In these areas, the skin becomes raised and a scar may form.
</p>

<p>
    Patients report a lot of sensitivity to sunlight (<strong>photosensitivity</strong>), and a change in the color of the extremities (fingers or toes) may occur, turning white or blue, triggered by cold and/or emotions. Sometimes, hair loss, formation of ulcers in the mouth or nose, <strong>joint pain</strong> (fingers, wrists, knees, ankles, or hip) with a morning predominance, and sometimes accompanied by stiffness and/or heat, redness, swelling, and difficulty in movements, generally without joint deformities, are observed.
</p>

<p>
    Other systems may be affected, such as the respiratory system, with inflammation of the lining of the lungs (<strong>pleura</strong>), which manifests as chest pain and cough; the cardiac system, with inflammation of the lining of the heart (<strong>pericardium</strong>), also with chest pain, but with different characteristics; and the renal system, with loss of proteins or other substances in the urine. More rarely, seizures, depression, greater susceptibility to infections, easy hemorrhages, or bruising may occur, due to a decrease in the number of platelets.
</p>

<p>
    Generally speaking, these symptoms are not present simultaneously, but rather in certain phases of the disease.
</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<p>
    There is still no known cause, except for the rare forms that are caused by the ingestion of specific drugs.
</p>

<p>
    Lupus is related to conditions that give rise to a certain <strong>predisposition</strong> for the disease. These causes can be of a <strong>genetic, hormonal, or environmental nature</strong>. <strong>Precipitating factors</strong> are situations that cause the condition to manifest in the form of evident symptoms and signs. These can be internal, such as <strong>physical stress</strong>, excessive tiredness, infections, sleep deprivation, trauma, pregnancy, or external, such as sunlight or artificial light and emotional <strong>stress</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

<p>
    Its diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory elements. Laboratory tests alone are not sufficient. However, together with the symptoms reported by the patient and the signs observed by the doctor, they are very useful. In some cases, diagnosis is difficult because the clinical data at that time are not sufficient. Furthermore, Lupus has very varied forms of presentation. Diagnosis depends on the combination of clinical and laboratory elements (blood and urine).
</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>

<p>
    The objective of treatment is the <strong>prevention of damage to vital organs</strong> and the <strong>maintenance of the disease in the inactive phase</strong>. It may include drugs, adequate exercise and rest, diet, and non-exposure to ultraviolet radiation and stress.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Medication:</strong> Drugs are necessary for most patients and constitute the most effective way to treat severe forms. These may have to be changed according to the phases of the disease. The most commonly used medications are <strong>anti-inflammatories</strong>, which reduce inflammation and pain, and are useful during the acute phases of the disease; <strong>antimalarials</strong>, which help stabilize the immune system; <strong>corticosteroids</strong>, important in severe skin and joint forms; <strong>immunosuppressants</strong>, which allow the reduction of the autoimmune inflammatory response that exists in Lupus; immunoglobulins and other newer drugs (biological therapies);
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Exercise and physiotherapy:</strong> An adequate <strong>balance between exercise and rest</strong> is essential. Physiotherapy and appropriate aerobic exercise (especially in water) help to relax and maintain the function of the muscles and joints;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Diet:</strong> Can be a determining factor, especially when there is kidney compromise, and must be adjusted to each case;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Care and protection from sun exposure:</strong> It is essential to <strong>avoid exposure to ultraviolet rays</strong> (solar or artificial), both directly and indirectly, as this exposure can precipitate flares in the skin and other organs. The use of <strong>sunscreens</strong> (with a high protection factor) in all outdoor activities, whether in summer or winter, on exposed areas is fundamental. Avoiding the hours of highest sun exposure during the hottest months and the use of <strong>appropriate clothing</strong> (long sleeves, wide-brimmed hats, light-colored clothes) can also be very important.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Prevention</h2>

<p>
    There is <strong>no way to prevent</strong> it. It is only possible to avoid some of the precipitating factors.
