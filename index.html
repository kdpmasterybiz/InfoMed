    <h2>What is Alzheimer's Disease?</h2>
    
    <p>
      Alzheimer's disease constitutes a neurological change that causes progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. It is currently the most common type of **dementia**, accounting for 60% to 80% of cases in the United States: in 2013, 6.8 million people were diagnosed with dementia, of which five million were classified as Alzheimer's. By 2050, these numbers are expected to double.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alzheimer's disease, which has an insidious onset and slow progression, affects episodic memory first and predominantly. The patient begins to have difficulty remembering recent fragments of their life, such as where they placed objects, errands, what they ate the day before, or what day of the month it is.
    </p>

    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    
    <p>
      Memory loss is slowly joined by other characteristic symptoms:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Difficulty recognizing people.</li>
      <li>Impoverished and fragmented speech while searching for words.</li>
      <li>Orientation in spaces becomes increasingly difficult.</li>
      <li>Over time, the first behavioral changes also begin to appear, with frequent visual hallucinations and delusional activity (the patient believing they are being robbed or persecuted), resulting in agitation and aggression.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      This set of difficulties increases until it is enough for the person to stop living autonomously, requiring assistance with tasks previously performed naturally, such as cooking, dressing, washing, and dealing with appliances or money.
    </p>

    <h2>Causes</h2>
    
    <p>
      As with other types of dementia, Alzheimer's is a **neurodegenerative disease**, which means there is a progressive loss of brain cells over time. The cerebral tissue contains fewer and fewer nerve cells, and the connections between them are lost.
    </p>

    <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    
    <p>
      The neurological examination is typically normal in the initial stages of Alzheimer's disease, as are imaging exams which, if not also regular, show only atrophy of the hippocampi—anatomical formations in the inner part of the cerebral hemispheres that play a fundamental role in the consolidation and evocation of new memories. In more advanced stages, patients often develop signs of **Parkinson's** (slowness and rigidity) and tests show atrophy of the entire brain.
    </p>

    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    
    <p>
      There is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease, as the death of brain cells cannot be reversed. However, there are therapeutic interventions that improve the lives of patients and facilitate the control of dementia, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Controlling other co-existing pathologies.</li>
      <li>Occupational therapy.</li>
      <li>Involvement in support groups and services.</li>
      <li>Drug therapy: medications that can reduce symptoms and help improve the quality of life of patients—cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, tacrine) and memantine.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Supportive care for daily activities becomes more important as the person is less able to live independently.
    </p>

    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    
    <p>
      There are risk factors that cannot be prevented, such as aging, a family history of Alzheimer's, and genetics. However, there are some factors that can help prevent the disease:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Regular physical activity.</li>
      <li>Prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (especially blood pressure control).</li>
      <li>Prevention and treatment of **diabetes**, **obesity**, and **smoking**.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      In general, a varied and healthy diet and remaining mentally and socially active can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
    </p>
